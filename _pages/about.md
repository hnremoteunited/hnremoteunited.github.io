HN Remote United was spawned from a [post on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22569404) as a free online workspace for workers who suddenly found themselves remote workers because of the [2019-20 Coronavirus Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and who miss the social aspect of the office.

It's a space where one can join any of the voice- or text chats and talk to others who are in the same situaton.

Channel set up by [romes](https://medium.com/@rodrigo.m.mesquita), and [simonskoog](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonskoog) fiddled around with github pages.
