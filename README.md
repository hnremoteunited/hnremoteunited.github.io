  <h1>Joining the HN Remote United Workspace</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <h3 id="step-1-sign-up-for-an-account-on-discord">Step 1) Sign up for an account on Discord</h3>

<p>Visit <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord on the web</a> and sign up for an account. We’d recommend configuring 2FA using the mobile app, but be wary that you might want to disable app-notifications that are enabled by default.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-install-a-discord-client-you-like-or-use-the-webapp">Step 2) Install a Discord client you like (or use the webapp)</h3>

<p>You can join Discord communities through the <a href="https://discordapp.com/app">Discord webapp</a> or with the <a href="https://discordapp.com/download">Official Client</a> which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)">Electron-based</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to try something different there is the <a href="https://cancel.fm/ripcord/">Ripcord - Desktop chat client for Slack and Discord</a> for Mac, Linux and Windows. Currently in alpha and built in C++ using Qt it consumes an order of magnitude less system memory than the default client and has previously been <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19617699">discussed on HN</a>.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-join-the-hn-remote-united-workspace">Step 3) Join the HN Remote United Workspace</h3>

<p>You join the workspace (‘Discord server’) by following <a href="https://discord.gg/2JtHmBa">this invite-link</a> which will open Discord in the browser and ask you to sign in. Your account will then be added to the workspace and you can close the webapp and open your preffered client.</p>
